## What is Error?

Explain that measurement error often comes in the shape of uncertainty, which is present in almost all data.



## Why and When do I Have to Worry?

* Triple whammy of ME
* When is error a problem?
* Bias versus variance 
* Is it sometimes better not to model the error?


It is surprising how many phenomena in statistics and its applications can be viewed through the measurement error lens. A prominant example is the concept of heritability in genetics and evolutionary biology, as we will explain in Section \@ref(sec:heritability).
