# Preface {-}

This is a _first draft_ of a book that deals with effects and cures of measurement error in variables of regression models. 

The presence and effects of measurement error and misclassification in covariates and the response of regression models have been recognized already more than a century ago. Thanks to huge efforts of plenty of researchers, in many settings, the consequences of ignoring measurement error or misclassification are known, at least in theory. 

When we say ``error'', we do not only  mean actual mistakes in the data that are used to fit regression models. 

kind of uncertainty, noise or  that are present in the data that we use to fit our models. 

* A ton of methods exist
* They go largely unused
* Possible reasons: 
    + Problems and methods unknown  
    + Often assumed that effect estimates are conservative
    + Solutions often complicated
    + Methods not accessible

We might develop a package. In this case, the **package-to-be-developed** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package-to-be-developed")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("stefaniemuff/package-to-be-developed")
```



```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
