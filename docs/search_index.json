Keller 2018-12-20 Preface This is a first draft of a book that deals with effects and cures of measurement error in variables of regression models. The presence and effects of measurement error and misclassification in covariates and the response of regression models have been recognized already more than a century ago. Thanks to huge efforts of plenty of researchers, in many settings, the consequences of ignoring measurement error or misclassification are known, at least in theory. When we say ``error’’, we do not only mean actual mistakes in the data that are used to fit regression models. kind of uncertainty, noise or that are present in the data that we use to fit our models. A ton of methods exist They go largely unused Possible reasons: Problems and methods unknown Often assumed that effect estimates are conservative Solutions often complicated Methods not accessible N. Breslow, Lessons in Biostatistics (2014) (Breslow 2014) wrote Obviously, [. . .] the best method of dealing with measurement error was to avoid it. I say: The second best method of dealing with measurement error is to properly account for it. We might develop a package. In this case, the package-to-be-developed package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;package-to-be-developed&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;stefaniemuff/package-to-be-developed&quot;) Follow me on Twitter! @StefanieMuff References "],
