["index.html", "Applied Error Modeling in Regression Preface", " Applied Error Modeling in Regression An Introduction with Examples in R Stefanie Muff and Lukas F. Keller 2018-12-22 Preface This is a first draft of a book that deals with effects and cures of measurement error in variables of regression models. The aim of the book is not only to discuss a broad range of problems and biases that are induced by measurement error, but mainly to bridge the gap between theory and the applications. The idea is to provide a basic toolkit of methods to make error modeling accessible to a broad audience in the applied sciences. The many examples discussed and analyzed in the book all come with the associated R code. Interestingly, the presence and effects of measurement error and misclassification in covariates and the response of regression models have been recognized already more than a century ago (see e.g. …). Thanks to huge efforts of many researchers, the consequences of ignoring measurement error or misclassification are known in many settings, at least in theory. Moreover, a huge variety of methods to appropriately deal with measurement error exist, and several textbooks in statistics are devoted to the topic (Fuller 1987; Gustafson 2004; Carroll et al. 2006; Yi 2017). Despite this, most – if not all – error modelig methods go largely unused. Why is this so? We can only hypothesize about the reasons, but the problem seems to have many factes. On one hand, measurement error is often nothing that seems worth paying attention to, and given that even most introductory textbooks in applied statistics do not discuss measurement error, it is not surprising that entire generations of young scientists get educated in statistics and data analysis without ever having hard of the problems it may cause. On the other hand, error modeling methods can quickly become very challenging. Unless the problem is a very standard case, it is often necessary to formulate a new model, and it may be all but obvious what the model should be, let alone how to implement an actual procedure to fit it. But even if the error model is relatively simple, like a standard classical measurement model in a covariate of a regression model (see Section 2.1), some extra-effort and more specialist software packages are required. As a consequence, the hurdle to get started with the proper handling of measurement error in data is much higher than for standard regression analyses. If you are reading these lines, we assume that you either have a very specific measurement error problem at hand, or you would like to get a gentle introduction into the topic and its applications. … When we say ``error’’, we do not only mean actual mistakes in the data that are used to fit regression models. Kind of uncertainty, noise or imprecision that are present in the data that we use to fit our models. N. Breslow, Lessons in Biostatistics (2014) (Breslow 2014) wrote Obviously, [. . .] the best method of dealing with measurement error was to avoid it. I say: The second best method of dealing with measurement error is to properly account for it. We might develop a package. In this case, the package-to-be-developed package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;package-to-be-developed&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;stefaniemuff/package-to-be-developed&quot;) Follow us on Twitter! @StefanieMuff @LukasFKeller References "],
